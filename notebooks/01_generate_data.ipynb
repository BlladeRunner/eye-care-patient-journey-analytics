    "## Purpose\n",
    "This notebook generates a **fully synthetic, privacy-safe dataset** that simulates the patient journey in eye care:\n",
    "from clinical recommendation to purchase, retention, and downstream revenue.\n",
    "\n",
    "The goal is to enable **end-to-end analytics** (funnel, cohorts, uplift) while ensuring:\n",
    "- full reproducibility,\n",
    "- no use of sensitive or proprietary patient data,\n",
    "- realistic relational structure between entities."

    "## Data Model Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "The synthetic dataset consists of multiple related tables:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **patients** — demographic and market attributes\n",
    "- **visits** — clinical visits and recommendations\n",
    "- **recommendations** — recommended product tier and category\n",
    "- **transactions** — purchases, revenue, channel\n",
    "- **outcomes** — adoption and follow-up signals\n",
    "\n",
    "Relationships:\n",
    "- One patient → many visits\n",
    "- One recommendation → optional purchase\n",
    "- Purchases generate revenue and retention signals\n",
    "\n",
    "Distributions and probabilities are intentionally simplified but calibrated\n",
    "to produce realistic funnel drop-offs and cohort behavior."

    "Running this notebook from top to bottom will regenerate all raw CSV files\n",

    "\n",
    "This approach mirrors real-world constraints in healthcare analytics,\n",
    "where analysts often work with synthetic or anonymized datasets."
